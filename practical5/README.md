# Practical 5

This folder contains practical 5 codes, fibseries.c (which calculates the Fibonacchi series) and arctanh.c (which calculates arctanh(x)).

## Compile:

* gcc fibseries.c -o fibseries
+ gcc arctanh.c -o arctanh

## Execute

*./fibseries
*./arctanh

##Results
* (For input n = 15):
 enter a positive integer n
15
